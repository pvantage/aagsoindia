    Alcoholics Anonymous is an international fellowship of men and women who once had a drinking problem. It is nonprofessional, self-supporting, nondenominational, apolitical, and available almost everywhere. There are no age or educational requirements. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about his or her drinking problem. <br>
    <br>
    <b>WHAT DOES A.A. DO?</b> <br>
    <br>
   <ol class="order-list mt-3">
   
   
   <li>A.A. members share their experience with anyone seeking help with a drinking problem; they give person-to-person service or “sponsorship” to the alcoholic coming to A.A. from any source.</li>
   
   <li>The A.A. programme, set forth in our Twelve Steps, offers the alcoholic a way to develop a satisfying life without alcohol.</li>
   
   
   
   
   <li>This programme is discussed at A.A. group meetings. 
   
    <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
        <li>Open speaker meetings-open to alcoholics and non alcoholics. (Attendance at an open A.A. meeting is the best way to learn what A.A. is, what it does, and what it does not do.) At speaker meetings, A.A. members “tell their stories.” They describe their experiences with alcohol, how they came to A.A., and how their lives have changed as a result of A.A.</li>
        <li>Open discussion meetings-one member speaks briefly about his or her drinking experience, and then leads a discussion on A.A. recovery or any drinking-related problem anyone brings up.(Closed meetings are for A.A.s or anyone who may have a drinking problem.)</li>
        <li>Closed discussion meetings-conducted just as open discussions are, but for alcoholics or prospective A.A.s only.</li>
        <li>Step meetings (usually closed)-discussion of one of the Twelve Steps.</li>
        <li>A.A. members also take meetings into correctional and treatment facilities.</li>
        <li>A.A. members may be asked to conduct the informational meetings about A.A. as a part of A.S.A.P. (Alcohol Safety Action Project) and D.W.I. (Driving While Intoxicated) programme. These meetings about A.A. are not regular A.A. group meetings.</li>
